# CYPHES v0.5.1 Release Assets

Historical archive. The current public testnet seed is CYPHES v0.6.2; use the
current download in the root [README](../../README.md#download) unless you are
verifying this older release.

Apple Silicon developer preview DMGs were built locally from the v0.5.1 source state.

## Fix

v0.5.1 replays locally stored work-unit claims and signed contributions when peers reconnect. A Worker can submit a work unit while the Requester is offline, then deliver that signed contribution later without rerunning the audit.
