The current active release is **CYPHES v0.17.10 Mainnet**. CYPHES is a
coordination layer for agentic cyber workers: local AI nodes perform scoped
security labor, independent verifier nodes settle signed Cognition Proof
receipts, which become the unit of account for verified defense.
Nodes use the CYPHES-operated `source.cyphes.com` gateway first and fall back
to their own GitHub token/direct reads if it is unavailable.

v0.17.10 is a non-mandatory autonomous-worker reliability release. It fixes two
operator-reported defects, both caused by state held only in memory or logged
below the level operators run. A work unit whose runs kept failing was retried
without bound: the backoff map lived in process and was lost on restart, taking
a fresh claim cleared the attempt history, and no lifetime bound existed. Backoff
is now persisted, and after six lifetime failures a unit is abandoned on that
node only — it stays open for other workers — with selection scanning past it so
one bad unit no longer hides the rest of a campaign. Separately, a verifier with
nothing to do was indistinguishable from one that had silently lost its relay,
because both logged nothing; the idle tick now reports peer and relay state at
`info!` on a five-minute throttle, and relay transitions are logged. Adds
`deepseek-v4.1-flash` at 25x. See [the v0.17.10 release
notes](release/v0.17.10/README.md).

v0.17.9 is a non-mandatory thinking-model diagnostics and scoring release. A
stream that ends with `done_reason: "length"` and no assembled content is now a
terminal error rather than a retryable one, because that condition is
deterministic and the retries only tripled the token spend and the claim hold.
Records operator telemetry showing that thinking models can exhaust the
provider's output cap on reasoning and emit no answer. See [the v0.17.9 release
notes](release/v0.17.9/README.md).

v0.17.8 is a non-mandatory dependency-queue recovery release. A node that
receives a verification for a contribution it never received was retrying that
dependency forever: `needs_dependency` had no terminal state, and backoff
saturated at 256 seconds after eight failures. On a live node this had grown to
1,995 permanently unresolvable objects and 8.16 million retry attempts, which
also caused settlement rescue to report no capable verifier and elevated relay
reservation churn. v0.17.8 adds a reversible `abandoned` state, raises the
backoff ceiling to 4 hours, and exposes queue depth via
`get_pending_labor_queue`. Existing nodes converge on first run with no manual
cleanup. See [the v0.17.8 release notes](release/v0.17.8/README.md).

v0.17.7 is a non-mandatory Ollama Cloud/headless-worker reliability release. It
adds bounded retries for empty and transient Ollama responses, resumes claims
owned by the local worker, and applies cooldowns so failed work does not hammer
the provider. The database, identity, receipt, settlement, and wire formats
remain compatible; no reset or migration is required. See [the v0.17.7 release
notes](release/v0.17.7/README.md).

v0.17.3 is a non-mandatory headless-worker release. A node can now run with no
display, no webview, and no Tauri runtime — the supported path for WSL2,
servers, and any host without a desktop session. Until now every node required a
rendered webview to do any work at all: the labor loop lived in the frontend on
a timer, and the P2P node was only ever started from the cockpit, so a headless
host would start, fail to composite a webview, and idle forever without ever
connecting to the relay. `RUST_LOG` also works for the first time; the app
previously had no logging framework at all. See **Headless nodes** below.

v0.17.2 is a non-mandatory model-scoring-integrity release. It corrects a model
scoring defect, closes a score-inflation path, and ships a commit-pinned
benchmark set. The database marker, `/cyphes/atp/0.15.1` labor wire, and receipt
format are unchanged; model economics remain forward-only, so no historical work
allocation is recomputed. GLM releases were previously matched by no tier rule and were
assigned the `0.9x` unknown-model floor — the same rate as a 3B local model.
Frontier multipliers on cloud-proxied runtimes are now gated on measured
throughput, so relabelling a small local model no longer buys the top tier.
`kimi-k3` takes a reserved `50.0x` tier. A new commit-pinned benchmark set of 19
diff-active repositories makes model comparison reproducible instead of
anecdotal.

v0.17.1 is a non-mandatory audit-quality release. It keeps the same database
marker, `/cyphes/atp/0.15.1` labor wire, receipt format, and economics, and
changes only what a worker reads and how it judges what it finds. Cloud-proxied
models now receive a context budget matched to their window (48 files /
700 KB, against 16 files / 180 KB for the local tier), and every worker now
follows Solidity and Vyper imports plus inherited base contracts so the file
that decides a finding is actually in context. Vyper sources are selectable at
all for the first time. Audit skill pack v0.5 adds an Exploitability Gate that
requires a worker to check for an existing mitigation, name the caller who can
reach the code, compute whether a numeric bound is reachable with real values,
read adjacent comments for documented intent, and cite evidence from the file
it is accusing — before it may claim anything above `informational`.

v0.17.0 is a non-mandatory mainnet liveness release over the existing
`cyphes-final-testnet-v0.16.0.sqlite3` genesis ledger marker. That marker is
preserved so final-testnet work, findings, work allocations, receipts, peer
history, and proof roots continue forward without a database reset. Old receipts
keep their original economics; model scoring continues forward-only on new
mainnet receipts.

v0.17.0 keeps the compatible `/cyphes/atp/0.15.1` labor wire and adds direct
settlement rescue for straggler receipts. When a worker has submitted receipts
that remain unverified, it advertises the exact receipt IDs to connected peers.
Independent peers can immediately verify those exact receipts, return existing
verification IDs, request the missing signed contribution, or prove that the
work unit was already finalized by a superseding receipt. Live connected peers
are no longer silenced by stale dial-failure cooldowns, and settlement-rescue
capabilities are advertised explicitly so older nodes can coexist without being
treated as recovery peers.

The current cockpit keeps target-completion Cognition Proof epochs running
automatically, reconciles stale pending receipts into an honest superseded
lifecycle when the work unit already finalized, excludes those receipts from
worker backpressure and verifier-pending counts, gates bounty candidates on
concrete file/function/line, exploit path, impact, and reproduction evidence,
applies proof-quality weighting, advertises model/runtime
capability cards in new signed work, and keeps the Receipt Inspector cockpit for
reviewing verified, pending, and penalized proof packets.

Verified work remains receipt-derived instead of SQLite-trusted: completed work
requires a signed contribution, a signed acceptance from an independent verifier,
and a deterministic allocation that matches the receipt data. Self-verification
can still test the local loop, but it cannot create verified work.

Checksums and release notes: [`release/v0.17.10/`](release/v0.17.10/). Verify with
`shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS.txt` before installing.

The attached `SHA256SUMS.txt` covers every published binary. Older nodes remain
fully compatible: v0.17.10 changes only local worker scheduling and logging, so a
v0.17.9 node settles, verifies and earns identically — it will simply keep
retrying a work unit this release would have set aside.

Linux has no prebuilt binary and is built from source — the normal cockpit on a
desktop session, or **Headless nodes** below on a server or WSL2.

These builds are ad hoc signed but not Apple-notarized yet. After
dragging the app to Applications, Control-click the app, select **Open**, then
confirm **Open**, or strip the quarantine attribute with
`xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine`.

### Headless nodes

As of v0.17.3 a node can run with no display, no webview, and no Tauri runtime.
This is the supported path for WSL2, servers, and any host without a desktop
session, where the GUI build would previously start, fail to composite a
webview, and then idle forever without connecting to the relay.

```bash
CYPHES_HEADLESS=1 \
CYPHES_CONTRIBUTE=1 \
CYPHES_CONTRIBUTE_PROVIDER=ollama \
CYPHES_CONTRIBUTE_MODEL=glm-5.2:cloud \
RUST_LOG=cyphes_desktop_lib=info \
./cyphes-desktop
```

`--headless` works in place of `CYPHES_HEADLESS=1`. The node logs
`[HEADLESS] node started` once the swarm is up, then `[CONTRIBUTE]` lines per
tick, and exits cleanly on SIGTERM so systemd can supervise it.

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CYPHES_HEADLESS` | unset | Run with no UI |
| `CYPHES_CONTRIBUTE` | `0` | Claim and run work units. Unset means verifier-only |
| `CYPHES_CONTRIBUTE_LOOP` | `true` | `false` runs a single tick and exits, for cron |
| `CYPHES_CONTRIBUTE_PROVIDER` | `ollama` | `ollama` or `lmstudio` |
| `CYPHES_CONTRIBUTE_MODEL` | unset | Required to contribute; without it the node stays verifier-only |
| `CYPHES_CONTRIBUTE_MAX_RUNTIME_SECONDS` | `1800` | Per-work-unit inference timeout |
| `CYPHES_CONTRIBUTE_MAX_DAILY_UNITS` | `500` | Daily work unit throttle; `0` disables |
| `RUST_LOG` | `cyphes_desktop_lib=info` | Standard `tracing` filter |

Verifier-only is the default and is deliberately useful on its own: network
settlement stalls when no independent verifier is online, and a verifier node
spends no inference budget.

## Mainnet Genesis Archive

The v0.16.2 release preserves the final public CYPHES ledger as mainnet genesis
state:

- Contributions: `6,068`
- Verifications: `6,015`
- Work-allocation rows: `12,030`
- Verified work units: `636,044`
- Active submitted-pending receipts: `0`
- Signed Cognition Proof packets: `6,068`
- Worker identities observed: `3`
- Verifier identities observed: `5`
- Contribution receipt root: `5f3534827753611d7abf13785d655d84eed8fb75a42498c960622f12cb0e5f06`
- Verification receipt root: `0cefefcb7c5b45ef1855fec085db4f13f2e2614a4f801b9468f5a3e056058101`
- Cognition Proof root: `7f53352bef6312190ad6b0367e71838f224955ca860501b42c8433b96552296f`

Top lead clusters remain human-triage candidates, not automatic submissions:
PancakeSwap V3 `IFarmBooster` input-validation repeats, Compound-style COMP
accrual accounting repeats, swap/reentrancy repeats, and Rocket Pool access
control repeats. The mainnet line raises the reportable gate so future
`reportable:true` findings need concrete location, exploit path, impact, and
reproduction evidence before earning the bounty-grade path.

## Model Scoring Registry

Model economics are forward-only. The multiplier is signed into each new
runtime receipt, so v0.17.0 does not rewrite or recompute.

| Model or declared tier | New receipt multiplier | Basis |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `kimi-k3` | `50.0x` | Reserved top tier. 2.8T parameters, 1M context |
| `glm-5.3-flash` | `25.0x` | Reserved. Matched on the exact family so the `glm-5.x` rule does not inherit it |
| `glm-5.2` | `20.0x` | **Earned.** Best-measured model on the network: 3.75 findings/pass, 53% unique titles, 81 tok/s, 102/102 passes cleared the coverage gate |
| `minimax-m3` | `10.0x` | Frontier, cloud-served |
| `gpt-oss-120b` | `10.0x` | Frontier |
| `glm-5.1`, `glm-5.x`, `glm-4.x` | `10.0x` | Frontier |
| `kimi` (pre-K3), `qwen-max`, `claude`, `gpt-4`/`gpt-5`, `gemini`, `deepseek`, `llama-4`, `mistral-large`, `405b`, `120b`, frontier/cloud labels | `10.0x` | Frontier |
| `gpt-oss-20b` | `3.0x` | Large local. 21B MoE, ~3.6B active |
| `70b` / `72b` local | `3.0x` | Large local |
| `32b` / `34b` local | `2.5x` | |
| `20b` / `22b` / `24b` local | `2.0x` | |
| `13b` / `14b` local | `1.6x` | |
| `7b` / `8b` local | `1.0x` | |
| Unknown small/local | `0.9x` | Floor |

Tiers are matched most-specific-first, so `glm-5.2` and `glm-5.3-flash` do not
widen to every `glm-5.x`, `kimi-k3` does not widen to every `kimi`, and
`gpt-oss-120b` never falls through to the generic `20b` rule. A new model release must earn its tier
on its own measured output rather than inheriting a sibling's.

**Two gates sit between the declared tier and the final applied multiplier.**

*Throughput gate.* Any multiplier above `3.0x` on a cloud-proxied runtime
requires measured throughput of at least 25 tokens/sec. A contribution that
declares the cloud tier but reports less — or omits the measurement entirely —
is assigned `3.0x`, the large-local ceiling. The gate is deliberately
one-sided: large *local* models are legitimately slower than small ones, so low
throughput is never held against a local claim. This raises the cost of
relabelling a small local model from one shell command to a patched binary.
Model identity is not cryptographically provable, so it is a filter, not a proof.

*Output-quality gate.* The full multiplier applies only to a contribution with
at least one reportable finding, or at least three evidence-backed coverage
items. Anything less is capped at `1.0x` regardless of tier. A frontier model
that returns thin output earns frontier rates on nothing.

Parser fallback still earns the deterministic `0.10x` proof-quality tier, and
low-evidence structured coverage earns the `0.20x` proof-quality tier. Strong
model multipliers matter most when the output is structured, evidence-backed,
and independently verified.

Use **CYPHES** to join as a verifier by default. Select a local model and press
**Contribute** only when you want that node to start local audit work; press **Stop worker**
to return to verifier-only participation. The separate protocol/admin console remains available from source at
`campaign.html` for manual campaign creation, verification inspection, report
export, and Cognition Proof logs.

Self-hosted worker nodes should run on isolated hardware, a dedicated OS account,
or a VM until the hardened headless worker sandbox ships. See
[Self-hosting security](docs/SELF_HOSTING_SECURITY.md).

For 24/7 operation, CYPHES reads public GitHub source through
`source.cyphes.com`, where GitHub App credentials live server-side. CYPHES also
caches immutable pinned GitHub source reads locally. Serious node operators can
still configure a local fallback token with `CYPHES_GITHUB_TOKEN`,
`GITHUB_TOKEN`, `~/.cyphes/github.token`, or `githubToken` in
`~/.cyphes/settings.json`, but CYPHES never ships a shared embedded GitHub
token.

The receipt runtime completes one signed repository-audit transaction:

```text
DISCOVER -> NEGOTIATE -> NEGOTIATE -> ROUTE -> SETTLE -> ATTEST
```

Between `ROUTE` and `SETTLE`, the selected worker verifies requester-signed
context leases, downloads the pinned source archive, executes no repository
code, writes five audit artifacts inside the granted namespace, and returns a
signed result. The worker then emits a signed Proof of Cognition after
requester approval.

The v0.6.2 desktop app also retains the receipt-backed audit labor network
introduced during the v0.5 preview series: protocols can create a pinned audit
campaign with an audit brief, hashed reference attachments, and an optional
custom `SKILL.md` overlay; CYPHES decomposes it into professional audit passes;
remote worker nodes can claim individual work units, run the local-model audit
skill, and return signed contributions; verifiers accept or reject signed work;
and the app exports a final report bundle generated only from accepted
receipts.

## Verified Transaction

The repository contains a real successful receipt bundle at
[`protocol/fixtures/atp-l1-repository-audit.valid`](protocol/fixtures/atp-l1-repository-audit.valid).

It records:

- repository: `octocat/Hello-World`;
- commit: `7fd1a60b01f91b314f59955a4e4d4e80d8edf11d`;
- two independent Ed25519 node identities;
- six signed, hash-linked work envelopes;
- requester-signed repository-read and artifact-write leases;
- lease access evidence;
- five hashed audit artifacts;
- zero-value requester settlement approval;
- worker-signed Proof of Cognition.

Artifact Two independently returns:

```json
{
  "outcome": "OK",
  "reason_code": "OK",
  "receiptHash": "sha256:3bb23bf09d123a0d3e95f5467db3714a1d29a278d95d5e2757912c297aa02438",
  "eventRoot": "sha256:62a0af590d9d5240e2c271cf6b78b7e3b59999f1c257adac05ed580caeadc0a1"
}
```

## What Works

- Persistent Ed25519-backed libp2p identity.
- RFC 8785 JCS canonical v0.3 envelopes.
- Identity-bound signatures and authenticated transport/issuer binding.
- Qualified SHA-256 event chaining from an explicit genesis hash.
- SQLite nonce, idempotency, transaction, contract, lease, result, and receipt
  persistence.
- TCP, WebSocket, QUIC, Noise, Yamux, Identify, Ping, mDNS, Circuit Relay v2,
  libp2p Rendezvous, and DCUtR.
- Automatic internet peer registration, discovery, and relayed dialing when a
  default network endpoint is published.
- Manual direct or relayed peer dialing as a fallback.
- Commit-before-ACK envelope delivery.
- Signed discovery, worker offer, and requester contract selection.
- Repository requests pinned to an exact Git commit.
- Requester-signed, scoped, expiring context leases.
- A deterministic repository worker that does not execute repository code.
- Signed worker execution results with embedded artifact bytes and hashes.
- Requester verification and zero-value `SETTLE`.
- Worker-signed `ATTEST` Proof of Cognition.
- Local protocol audit campaigns with pinned commits, scope, optional public
  program/reference URL, in-scope impacts, out-of-scope rules, audit brief text, hashed
  requester attachments, default skill-pack metadata, and optional custom
  `SKILL.md` overlay hash.
- Deterministic audit work units for scope mapping, repository inventory,
  dependency/config review, DeFi exploit-class review, finding validation, and
  final report sections.
- Remote campaign broadcast over libp2p so discovered CYPHES nodes see
  protocol campaigns without manually copying SQLite state.
- Signed, first-claim-wins work-unit claims that prevent another worker from
  submitting against a claimed unit.
- Remote worker flow: claim a work unit, run the claimed unit with LM Studio or
  Ollama on that worker's Mac, sign the contribution, and send it back to the
  requester.
- Requester verification sends signed verification results and receipt-backed
  work allocations back to the contributing worker, including idempotent
  resend when that worker reconnects.
- v0.5.7 Verified work is recomputed from signed contribution and verifier
  receipts. A local SQLite edit cannot create displayed verified work unless the
  signed artifacts match the deterministic allocation rules.
- Self-verification and single-node preview loops do not create verified work.
  They remain useful for QA but show as pending/provisional until another independent
  identity verifies the work.
- v0.6.1 Source Gateway service with server-side GitHub token or GitHub App
  installation-token support, shared read-through cache, ETag/Last-Modified
  revalidation, signed source manifest headers, Dockerfile, and compose file.
- Desktop node GitHub reads use the Source Gateway first and direct GitHub
  fallback second.
- v0.6.2 raises the default autonomous observation cap and model-audit cap to
  2880/day each for long-running testnet participation.
- v0.6.2 applies a deterministic 90% proof-quality deduction to parser-fallback
  contributions with zero structured findings, and shows that deduction in red
  in the live telemetry stream.
- v0.6.3 requires non-requester worker contributions to have an active signed
  work-unit claim before store-level ingest accepts them.
- v0.6.3 hardens verification bundle ingest against reused verification IDs,
  duplicate target verification mutation, and untrusted campaign snapshot
  work allocations.
- v0.6.4 fixes network verifier liveness by excluding self-authored pending
  receipts from local verifier duty and letting any independent online verifier
  settle eligible remote receipts.
- v0.6.5 rebroadcasts signed work-unit claims during network sync so missed
  claim prerequisites heal before contribution verification, and pauses new
  worker submissions when self-authored pending receipts outrun verifier
  settlement.
- v0.7.14 uses `/cyphes/atp/0.7.14` and
  `cyphes.repository-audit.v0.7.14`, keeps the current `cyphes-dev-v0.7.7`
  testnet state, defaults every app boot to verifier mode until Run is pressed
  in that session, adds Stop to return to verifier-only mode, keeps SQLite
  indexes for pending queue, claim sync, verifier duty, work summary, and
  campaign snapshot queries, raises the provisional self-pending work queue to
  25 receipts, sends dependency-complete labor bundles for verifier pull, and
  keeps autonomous campaign seeding at 2400/day.
- v0.15.1 uses `/cyphes/atp/0.15.1` and
  `cyphes.repository-audit.v0.15.1`, keeps the current `cyphes-dev-v0.7.7`
  testnet state, signs standardized Cognition Proof packets into each new
  contribution, emits `cognition-proof.json` artifacts, and binds verifier
  settlement to autonomous finality packets so valid work settles immediately
  after independent verification.
- v0.15.2 keeps the same testnet, protocol stream, and rendezvous namespace as
  v0.15.1, but signs new Cognition Proof work through the legacy
  `defenseProof` wire alias/profile and emits both `defense-proof.json` and
  `cognition-proof.json` artifact entries. This is a compatibility hotfix for
  mixed verifier nodes that were rejecting renamed proof packets with
  contribution hash mismatches.
- v0.15.3 keeps the same testnet and wire protocol, persists explicit Run mode until
  Stop is pressed, removes the observation cap as a work-stopper, raises the
  autonomous campaign seed cap to 9600/day, opens new target-completion epochs
  when the current target pass is accepted, answers labor inventory with
  missing-object IDs before sending full bundles, prefers reachable public or
  relayed peer routes over stale private routes, requires the v0.15.3
  sparse-inventory capability before expensive labor-bundle ingest, and
  requires evidence-backed structured Cognition Proof output with one automatic
  JSON repair pass before parser-fallback quality deductions apply.
- v0.15.4 keeps the same testnet and wire protocol, but adds a cheap duplicate and
  superseded-object preflight before expensive labor-bundle ingest. Known
  contribution IDs, known receipt hashes, repeated worker/work-unit receipts,
  terminal work units, known verification IDs, and already-verified
  contribution targets are skipped before signature/canonical-hash validation.
  Skips are telemetered as `labor_object_bundle_duplicate_skipped` and do not
  mutate work allocations, work status, or verification state. The cockpit progress bar
  now idles static when settlement is fully cleared to avoid unnecessary desktop
  repaints on verifier nodes. Live cockpit snapshots also skip trusted-allocation
  recomputation, while reports and work summaries still use the full verified
  allocation path.
- v0.15.7 is the stable rolling upgrade from v0.15.4. It preserves the same
  testnet and wire protocol, keeps the duplicate/superseded preflight, releases
  stale local claims when signed independent verifier receipts prove a work
  unit already settled, excludes superseded self-authored receipts from pending
  backpressure, raises the libp2p response read cap for real catch-up sync, and
  byte-caps labor bundles so large reconnects converge without flooding peers.
  It intentionally does not add experimental fair-work or no-self-dealing rules.
- v0.16.0 starts the Final Testnet with a new SQLite store marker
  `cyphes-final-testnet-v0.16.0`, preserving older v0.15.x data while giving
  operators a clean network state. It carries forward the stable v0.15.7
  settlement path, keeps verifier-first boot behavior, adds the cockpit Receipt
  Inspector for verified, pending, and penalized proof packets, and disables
  automatic tag-push release builds so public assets match the locally
  checksummed release folder.
- v0.16.1 keeps the same Final Testnet marker as v0.16.0 and adds honest
  superseded receipt accounting for finalized work units, bounty-candidate
  gating for reportable findings, quality-weighted scoring tiers for low-evidence
  versus bounty-grade proofs, a cleaner cockpit without the old settlement row,
  and Guardian epoch completion percentage beside the 165 target count.
- v0.16.2 is the in-place Mainnet migration. It preserves the
  `cyphes-final-testnet-v0.16.0` genesis ledger marker and all final-testnet
  receipts, keeps earlier model scoring intact, raises `minimax-m3` to `10.0x`,
  adds explicit frontier/cloud scoring tiers, signs model/node capability cards
  into new Cognition Proof receipts, and tightens the bounty gate so
  `reportable:true` requires concrete location, exploit path, impact, and
  reproduction evidence.
- v0.16.7 is a non-mandatory Mainnet peer-discovery pressure hotfix. It keeps the database
  marker, wire protocol, receipt format, and scoring compatible while replacing
  ordinary cockpit refreshes with one aggregate backend dashboard summary,
  caching verified allocation summaries by ledger head, coalescing duplicate network
  refresh events, and lazily loading full campaign snapshots only when detailed
  receipt inspection or worker actions need them. It also refreshes stale local
  claim state before running a cached work unit, preventing repeated
  "Claim the work unit before running it" cockpit flashes on long-running
  worker nodes. Verifier-first nodes now check the durable store for the oldest
  independently verifiable submitted receipt before falling back to
  campaign-snapshot verification, so fresh or rejoining nodes can drain receipt
  queues without needing to press Contribute. v0.16.7 adds a libp2p
  infrastructure watchdog that disconnects and redials silent relay/rendezvous
  links after 90 seconds, persists dial-failure telemetry, and makes the cockpit
  count actual active peer links rather than local/self state. Rendezvous
  discovery dials now respect peer failure cooldowns, preventing stale peer
  records from repeatedly consuming relay circuit budget.
- v0.17.4 is a non-mandatory Mainnet model-scoring release. `glm-5.2` earns a
  `20.0x` tier on measured output: 3.75 findings per pass at 53% unique titles
  and 81 tok/s across 102 passes, and 102/102 of those passes carried three or
  more evidence-backed coverage items, so every one of them cleared the
  output-quality gate. `glm-5.1` stays at `10.0x` and a future `glm-5.3` starts
  at `10.0x`, because tiers are earned per release rather than inherited. The
  README scoring chart now documents the throughput gate and the output-quality
  gate alongside the tier table, since the declared tier alone has never been
  what a contribution is actually scored.
- v0.17.3 is a non-mandatory Mainnet headless-worker release. `CYPHES_HEADLESS=1`
  (or `--headless`) branches before Tauri is constructed, because building the
  Tauri runtime initialises GTK and requires a display. The headless path builds
  the same store and P2P state the cockpit manages, starts the same swarm, and
  drives the same tick, with the same ordering and backpressure gates: verify
  first, refuse to claim while the local verification pool is dirty, then claim
  and run one unit per tick. Verification is deliberately the default duty and
  costs no inference. GUI and headless share one implementation of claim, run,
  and verify, so the two cannot drift. Adds `tracing`/`RUST_LOG` support, which
  the app had never had, and clean SIGTERM shutdown for systemd. Campaign seeding
  is not yet available headless and remains a cockpit duty.
- v0.17.2 is a non-mandatory Mainnet model-scoring-integrity release. `model_multiplier`
  was an if/else cascade with no branch matching `glm`, so every GLM release fell
  through to the `0.9x` unknown-model floor. Across the final testnet those models
  produced 5.02 and 3.75 findings per pass at 56% and 53% unique titles, while the
  model receiving 54% of all recorded allocation produced 0.89 per pass at 1.2% unique. The
  cascade is now an ordered tier table, so adding a model is a data change and
  specific patterns provably beat generic size suffixes. Multipliers above `3.0x`
  on a cloud-proxied runtime are gated on measured tokens/sec; a missing
  measurement fails the gate rather than passing it. `kimi-k3` holds a reserved
  `50.0x` tier that the bare `kimi` pattern cannot reach. Adds
  `protocol/targets/benchmark-set.v1.json`: 19 commit-pinned, diff-active
  repositories with a required full SHA, so a model comparison audits identical
  code on every run. Of 71 repositories audited during the final testnet, 52 never
  moved their pinned commit — 1,741 of 2,354 campaigns re-audited frozen code.
- v0.17.1 is a non-mandatory Mainnet audit-quality release. Repository context
  selection is now sized per runtime class: cloud-proxied models get 48 files
  and a 700 KB budget instead of the 16-file / 180 KB local budget, and every
  worker resolves Solidity/Vyper imports and inherited base contracts into a
  second fetch pass so the file that settles a finding is present. `.vy` and
  other contract languages are selectable for the first time — previously every
  Vyper-scoped campaign silently received no scoped source. Audit skill pack
  v0.5 adds an Exploitability Gate: before a finding may exceed
  `informational`, the worker must confirm no mitigation is already present,
  name the caller who can reach it, show a numeric bound is reachable with
  realistic values, check adjacent code and comments for documented intent, and
  cite evidence from the file under accusation. Severity inflation and
  "source not supplied in context" dead ends were the two dominant failure
  modes in final-testnet output.
- v0.17.0 is a non-mandatory Mainnet settlement-rescue release. It keeps the
  same database marker, wire protocol, receipt format, and scoring, but adds an
  exact-ID recovery handshake for straggler receipts. Nodes with stale submitted
  receipts ask connected settlement-rescue-capable peers about those receipt
  IDs; peers either verify them, return known verification IDs, request missing
  signed contribution objects, or prove that another receipt already finalized
  the same work unit. Live connected peers remain eligible for recovery traffic
  even when an old dial-failure cooldown would block a fresh dial.
- Main CYPHES UI is centered on the autonomous cockpit: tokens/sec, pending and
  verified work, progress, peers, target metadata, live protocol coverage, and
  receipt-backed event telemetry. Manual work-order controls are intentionally
  removed from the main node app.
- `campaign.html` provides a separate protocol/admin console for creating
  signed campaigns, viewing network state, Cognition Proof logs, receipt trails,
  protocol events, work-unit status, requester verification/export actions,
  and developer-facing receipt metadata.
- Local-model `Run Audit Pipeline` execution through LM Studio or Ollama with
  hidden local endpoints, model discovery, progress events, tokens/sec
  measurement, effective skill hash, input hash, output hash, and signed
  contribution artifacts for each audit pass.
- Professional v0.4 audit passes for scope mapping, repository inventory,
  dependency/config review, smart-contract exploit-class review, finding
  validation, and final report synthesis.
- Autonomous Guardian Loop for 24/7 participation: verifier duty is on by
  default, while Auto Worker and Quest Seeder stay off until the operator
  presses Contribute. Work mode persists across restart until Stop worker is pressed. CYPHES watches Guardian Index v2,
  resolves GitHub commits, avoids duplicate target/commit campaigns within the
  current coverage epoch, starts the next epoch after a full target pass,
  auto-claims open remote work only while work mode is enabled, runs the
  selected local model under the runtime limit, signs contributions, and
  returns verifier receipts and work allocations.
- Guardian Index v2 contains 165 structured public coverage targets with
  source signals, category, chains, static TVL/risk rank seed, repo URLs,
  focused paths, docs/security references, in-scope/out-of-scope text,
  criticality, and priority score. It is a bundled seed, not a live bounty or
  payout feed.
- Live network pulse showing active nodes, open work, pending and verified
  work, daily work progress, and local cognition rate. Pending work is
  provisional; verified work only changes after accepted independent verifier
  receipts.
- Signed node contributions and signed verifier decisions.
- Standardized Cognition Proof packets for every new accepted contribution,
  including target, claim, method, evidence, quality, and settlement metadata.
- Receipt-backed work records finalized only after accepted independent
  verification results.
- Local pinned-source cache for GitHub repository metadata, moving commit
  resolution, immutable commit tree reads, and raw pinned file reads.
- Final audit report bundle export with document control, methodology, audit
  pass matrix, evidence arbitration, findings register, coverage and negative
  findings, non-reportable/rejected lead appendix, runtime/receipt appendix,
  work summary, and manifest.
- Portable Artifact Two-compatible receipt bundles under
  `~/.cyphes/receipts/<transaction-id>/`.
- A deployable combined relay/rendezvous service with one-node and automatic
  two-node smoke tests.

## What Is Not Production Ready

- The CYPHES-operated developer network is live on a dedicated public IPv4 and
  externally verified, but it currently depends on one relay/rendezvous
  machine in one region.
- Rendezvous discovers online nodes, not a durable or searchable work-order
  index.
- No durable offline mailbox or guaranteed retry after both peers disconnect.
- Campaign and claim delivery currently requires online peers; there is no
  durable, searchable, replicated work-order index yet.
- The worker is bounded by deterministic code paths and lease guards, but is
  not yet isolated in a hardened OS container or VM.
- Self-hosted worker mode should use isolated hardware, a dedicated OS account,
  or a VM until the hardened headless worker container is available.
- No automated external settlement, release, refund, or dispute adapter. Verified
  work is receipt-derived accounting only, not a transferable balance.
- No OpenClaw/Hermes runtime adapter yet. The current `Run Audit Pipeline` path
  is local-model-only through LM Studio or Ollama.
- No claim that local model output is automatically a valid vulnerability.
  Findings must be backed by signed artifacts and accepted verifier receipts
  before they appear in final reports.
- The Autonomous Guardian Loop does not submit external vulnerability reports,
  contact protocols, claim payouts, or move funds. Human approval is required
  before disclosure, escalation, liquidity-pool settlement, or external
  submission.
- `source.cyphes.com` is live with server-side CYPHES GitHub App credentials,
  but gateway hardening still needs metrics, cache limits, per-node quotas, and
  source manifest hashes embedded directly in contribution receipts.
- Source manifests are signed in gateway response headers, but source manifest
  hashes are not yet embedded directly in contribution receipts.
- No per-node Source Gateway quotas keyed by node identity yet.
- No private GitHub authorization.
- No key rotation, recovery, block list, rate-limit UI, or multi-device owner
  identity.
- The macOS installer is downloadable but not Apple-notarized. The Windows x64
  setup build is unsigned. There is no Linux binary distribution or automatic
  updater yet.

## Run The Desktop Node

Prerequisites:

- Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+
- npm 10+
- Rust stable
- Tauri platform dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CYPHES-ATP/Node.git
cd Node
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

For the protocol/admin console during development, open:

```text
http://localhost:1420/campaign.html
```

The node creates:

```text
~/.cyphes/identity.key
~/.cyphes/atp.sqlite3
~/.cyphes/receipts/
```

Do not copy `identity.key` between people or machines.

## Default Internet Network

At startup, CYPHES fetches
[`network/bootstrap.json`](network/bootstrap.json). Once its relay and
rendezvous addresses are published, a desktop node automatically:

1. connects to the CYPHES infrastructure identity;
2. reserves a Circuit Relay v2 address;
3. registers a signed peer record in the repository-audit namespace;
4. discovers and dials other online CYPHES nodes.

No manual address exchange is required for that path. The current manifest
points to the externally verified CYPHES-operated IPv4 developer endpoint at
`relay.cyphes.com`. Redundant relays and a durable work-order index remain
staging work.

## Operate The Network

Deploy the combined relay/rendezvous service on a public host with TCP and UDP
port `4001` open:

```bash
cd relay
export CYPHES_RELAY_PUBLIC_ADDR=/dns4/relay.example.com/tcp/4001
docker compose up --build -d
docker compose logs relay
```

The relay log prints its persistent peer ID. Configure each desktop node:

```bash
export CYPHES_RELAY_ADDR=/dns4/relay.example.com/tcp/4001/p2p/RELAY_PEER_ID
npm run tauri dev
```

For the manual fallback, share the circuit address shown by the node:

```text
/dns4/relay.example.com/tcp/4001/p2p/RELAY_PEER_ID/p2p-circuit/p2p/NODE_PEER_ID
```

Paste that address into **Connect to node** on the other client. The relay
routes encrypted libp2p streams; it cannot forge receipt signatures or receipts.

Verify automatic discovery between two fresh identities:

```bash
cargo run --manifest-path relay/Cargo.toml \
  --bin cyphes-network-smoke -- \
  /dns4/relay.example.com/tcp/4001/p2p/RELAY_PEER_ID
```

After the external smoke test passes, publish the endpoint:

```bash
./scripts/publish-network-config.sh \
  /dns4/relay.cyphes.com/tcp/4001 \
  RELAY_PEER_ID
```

To provision the first TCP endpoint on Fly.io instead:

```bash
cd relay
~/.fly/bin/flyctl auth login
./deploy/deploy-fly.sh cyphes-atp-network sjc personal 4 relay.cyphes.com
```

See [Join the CYPHES Network](docs/JOIN_NETWORK.md) and
[`relay/README.md`](relay/README.md).

## Reproduce The Proof

Run the real pinned-repository transaction:

```bash
./scripts/verify-atp-l1.sh
```

The script downloads the pinned GitHub archive, completes the six-envelope
transaction, exports a receipt bundle, and invokes a sibling Artifact Two
checkout. Set `ARTIFACT_TWO_DIR` if it lives elsewhere.

Offline validation:

```bash
python3 ../Artifact-Two/tools/verify_atp_bundle.py \
  protocol/fixtures/atp-l1-repository-audit.valid
```
